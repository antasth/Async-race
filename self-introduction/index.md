Hello! My name is Anton. I am a student of Rsschool frontend course.

I am a graduate of the Donetsk National Technical University with a specialization in Information Systems and Technologies.

I have nine years of working experience as a system administrator, but since last year I decided to study frontend development.

At the moment I have been studying for about a year and I believe that I have achieved some success. When I first started last year I knew something about html and css and thought - wow it's pretty simple, but when I looked at the js code first time I thought - what kind of aliens wrote it ? And now I can write something in this language myself. So when I feel this progress it motivates me to study further.

Next I would like to show and tell you about my projects.

After the basic html and css course, I made up several site layouts using Figma, html and css, then I start learning javascript and made more projects. This stage took about 6 - 7 months.

After that i decided that I get some expirience and ready to start learning react. I watched a video on how to create a todo application, and I felt that I could do something myself in react.

This is how my first pet project on react appeared, which I called ReactShop.
In this project I learned how to create components, use props, hooks, context, fetching data from the server, page routing, using ready-made ui components, for example, from chackra ui.

In this project I have created several pages, the main page, product page, favorites, shopping cart, gallery and comparison page.
I've been working on this project for about 3 months and it was a great experience.

After the first project, I decided it was time to start learning the redux toolkit and I decided to do it on a new project, which I called React timer. This project is similar to React shop, but it has filters and sorting, data is stored on the mockapi site and the Redux Toolkit is used here.

But I didn't have time to work well with Redux Toolkit because literally the day before starting the Rsschool frontend course I found out about the existence of this course and I decided that this was a great opportunity to improve my knowledge of javascript and start to studying on Rsschool course.

Since the beginning of the course, I have done several good tasks that have improved my skills.

The first project was shelter, after that I made a virtual keyboard and literally today I finished the minesweeper task.

This has been my path in learning JS over the past year, and I hope that further assignments will bring me more experience and knowledge.

Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed it!
